					<p>Plants such as ferns and mosses don't have flowers. They produce spores instead of seeds.</p>
					<p>Spores are tiny specks of living material</p>
				</section>

					<p>Mosses have spores that are found inside a capsule</p>
					<p>These spores are dispersed by the wind</p>

					<p>Ferns have feathery leaves and their stems are underground</p>
					<p>Their spores are found on the underside of their leaves</p>

					<h5>Glossary</h5>
					<p class="fragment"><b>explode</b><span class="fragment">: to burst open with a lot of force</span></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>seed dispersal</b><span class="fragment">: when seeds are spread or scattered away from the plant where they are formed</span></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>seedlings</b><span class="fragment">: the new plants that grow from a germinated seed</span></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>spongy</b><span class="fragment">: like a sponge with soft holes that can be filled with air or water</span></p>

					<h5>Questions, Page 17</h5>

					<p class="fragment"><b>Q.1 Which seeds would grow better: those in a tomato left on the plant, or those in a tomato eaten by a bird? Say why.</b>
					<p class="fragment">The seeds eaten by the bird would grow better. 
					<br/> The bird would spread the seeds in its droppings away from the parent plant. 
					<br/> The seedlings would not be overcrowded like the seedlings that germinate right next to the parent plant.
					<br/> They would be able to get more light and water for growth.</p></p>

					<p class="fragment">
					<b>Q.2 Do you think peach seeds can be dispersed by animals? Say why or why not.</b>
					<p class="fragment">No. Animals do not eat peach seeds which are big and hard. The seeds do not have spikes or hooks either. The seeds are also slightly poisonous.</p>

					<p class="fragment">
					<b>Q.3 Make a drawing of a seed you think would be dispered in an animal's fur.</b>
					<p class="fragment">The seed will have spines or hooks or spikes that can get caught in an animal's fur.</p>

					<p class="fragment">
					<b>Q.4 How can people disperse seeds?</b>
					<p class="fragment">People disperse seeds by planting them in their gardens or farms.</p>

					<p class="fragment">
					<b>Q.1 A water lily seed has a spongy covering. How does this help a water lily disperse its seeds?</b>
					<p class="fragment">The spongy seed coat has air spaces that trap air and help the seed to float. (water disperal)</p>

					<p><b>Q4. Describe another way in which plants are adapted to seed dispersal by animals. Give an example</b></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>A:</b> Some plants have fruits that animals like to eat. The animals eat the fruit which contain the seeds. The seeds are spread in the animalsâ€™ droppings.</p>
					<p><b>Q5. Why must seeds be spread?</b></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>A:</b> So they grow away from the parent plant and have enough space, light and water to grow into new plants.</p>
